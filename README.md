# Welcome to Heart Disease Predictor repository

## About
This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on health data from CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. The project aims to predict if a person needs to go for a health check-up due to having a high risk of heart disease. The project involves data cleaning, data visualization, and machine learning.

##Problem Definition
The project aims to predict if a person needs to go for a health check-up due to having a high risk of heart disease. The following questions were addressed:
* Are we able to predict if you need to go for health check up due to having high risk of heart disease?
* Which model would be the best to predict it?

## Models Used
The following machine learning models were used to predict if a person needs to go for a health check-up due to having a high risk of heart disease:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Classification

## Conclusion
The project was able to create a good model to determine if a user is due for a check-up with a 75% accuracy and 79% true positive rate. Resampling imbalanced data improved model performance. The following features were found to have the highest correlation to heart disease: general health, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and high blood sugar.

## What We Learned
The project provided a chance to explore the following:

New machine learning models: SVC and Random Forest
Resampling Techniques: Random Oversampling and SMOTE
Collaborating using GitHub
Concepts about Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
