# Welcome to Heart Disease Predictor repository

## About

This is a Mini-Project for SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) which focuses on health data from [CDC's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/data_documentation/index.htm). For detailed walkthrough, please view the source code in order from:

## Problem Definition

- Are we able to predict if you need to go for health check up due to having high risk of heart disease?
- Which model would be the best to predict it?

## Models Used

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Support Vector Classification

## Conclusion

- Successfully created a good model to determine if user is due for a check up (75% Accuracy and 79% True Positive Rate)
- Resampling imbalanced data improved model performance
- General health, high blood pressure, high blood cholestrol and high blood sugar yield the highest correlation to heart disease.

## What did we learn from this project?

- New machine learning models: SVC and Random Forest
- Resampling Techniques: Random Oversampling and SMOTE
- Collaborating using GitHub
- Concepts about Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
